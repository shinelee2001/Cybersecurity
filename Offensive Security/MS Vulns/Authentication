NTLM & NET-NTLM

Current Windows enables VTL1 (VSM Secure Mode; a.k.a Isolated User-Mode) by default.
Thus, even we try to leverage NTLM hashes from LSASS process (under VTL0), 
LSASS retrieves encrypted hashes from LSAISO (under VTL1) through an RCP channel.
--> In this case, we could try to extract the credentials while the user is logged on.

Windows supports various authentication mechanisms including LSA, Winlogon, SSPI, etc.
--> SSPI is used by all applications and services that require authentication.

Windwos supports various SSP like Kerberos SSP, NTLM SSP, etc.
and these are incorporated into the SSPI as DLLs.
*** SSP can also be registerd through the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE > System > CurrentControlSet > Control > Lsa > Security Packages registry key.
--> Mimikatz supports this kind of exploitation with 'memssp'.
--> It does not simply provide SSP but injects it directly into the memory of the lsass.exe process without dropping any DLLs on disk.
ex usage)
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # misc::memssp

The injection completes, the credentials would be saved in C:\Windows\System32\mimilsa.log
